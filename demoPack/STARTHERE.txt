An intel operation has discovered that key enemy operations are being stored at the address:

IP:1400

While monitoring traffic destined to this IP address, the following hexadecimal code was frequently present at the beginning of each connection with the server:

97 8A 89 89 B1 80 86 8D

Other red team assets operating parallel to yours have obtained a copy of the executable the server is based off of, and intel suggests that there is a hexadecimal XOR key located somewhere in the executable. Your objective is to locate the key, decrypt the code, and break into the enemy server.
